Its longevity depends upon thousands of small design decisions taken every day, and each decision should be in sync with the other. This constant attention to detail is what makes a software system tick. Hence, the quality of software depends hugely on the efficiency of communication between humans building it. This observation became the basis of Conway’s Law.
Paraphrasing Dr. Melvin E. Conway, “Any organization that designs a system, will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization’s communication structure.</description></item><item><title>NFRs for Data Science Products</title><link>https://arjunsehajpal.github.io/posts/data-science-nfrs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Jun 2022 01:25:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://arjunsehajpal.github.io/posts/data-science-nfrs/</guid><description>Non-functional requirements (NFRs) are as important as functional requirements. While the system can still work if the NFRs are not met, it may not meet the stakeholders’ expectations. A functional requirement (FR) defines the specific behaviour of a system, whereas an NFR is a criterion to judge the operation of the system. For instance, a system should show a “list of orders” by the user is defined as a functional requirement, and how much time it takes for a page to load and show the first 10 orders is defined as a non-functional requirement.</description></item></channel></rss>

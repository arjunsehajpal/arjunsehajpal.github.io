For instance, in a multiclass classification problem, a decision tree provides a label, which is narrowed down going down the tree, where each node reduces the set of possible outcomes to one. On the contrary, the neural networks provide a vector of continuous values, which is calculated by applying non-linear transformations on the input vector.</description></item></channel></rss>

Hi! I am Arjun Sehajpal. I ply my trade as a Data Scientist at [ZS](https://www.zs.com/), working on Personalization Systems where my responsibilities include building end-to-end Machine Learning workflows. Previously, I worked at [Pluto7](https://pluto7.com/) as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I worked on developing Demand Forecasting and Supply Chain Optimization solutions. Over the years, I have worked on Structured Data problems (primarily, Time-Series), and very recently have delved into world of LLMs. As someone closely working with data, I am interested in:
- Machine Learning System Design
- Common Sense Reasoning, as models should go beyond pattern recognition
- Code Quality, using paradigms such as OOP, TDD and Design Principles
- Documentation, as it should be the primary mode of communication between development teams

Apart from being a Machine Learning Engineer, I also enjoy:
- Reading ([here's what I am currently reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/67593244-arjun-sehajpal?shelf=currently-reading))
- Philosophy (Epistemology in particular)
- Yoga

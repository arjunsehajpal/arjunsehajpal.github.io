Hi! I am Arjun Sehajpal. I ply my trade as a Data Science Associate at ZS, working on Personalization Systems. I have a keen interest in MLOps and Machine Learning System Design and love to work on [Time-Series](https://arjunsehajpal.github.io/tags/time-series/) and Causal ML problems. I code mostly in Python, and some Clojure (for personal projects).

When not working, I like to read Philosophy, Fiction, and Poetry. You can find what books I am currently reading [here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/67593244-arjun-sehajpal?shelf=currently-reading).

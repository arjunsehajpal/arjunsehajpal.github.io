Hi! I am Arjun Sehajpal. I ply my trade as a Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Visa, where I’m building a centralized AI platform that integrates open-source monitoring tools and governance APIs, enabling automated fairness, explainability, and model catalogue workflows.</br>

Before this, I spent almost five years at [ZS](https://www.zs.com/) across roles in Data Science and AI Engineering. My work there focused on designing and engineering AI/LLM systems, which included developing internal ML libraries, improving reproducibility and experimentation, and personalization systems.</br>

Prior to ZS, I worked at [Pluto7](https://pluto7.com/) as a Data Scientist on Demand Forecasting and Supply Chain Optimization use-cases using time-series modelling and scalable data pipelines.</br>

I’ve mostly worked on structured data systems and ML system design, and have steadily moved deeper into LLMs, infrastructure, and AI engineering.</br>

Outside work, I spend my time [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/67593244-arjun-sehajpal?shelf=currently-reading), practicing yoga, and slowly becoming a calmer, more deliberate person.

Hi! I am Arjun Sehajpal. I ply my trade as a Data Scientist at [ZS](https://www.zs.com/), working on Personalization Systems where my responsibilities include building end-to-end Machine Learning workflows. Previously, I worked at [Pluto7](https://pluto7.com/) as a Machine Learning Engineer, where I worked on developing Demand Forecasting and Supply Chain Optimization solutions, which were deployed on Google Cloud. 

I love Time-Series and Causal-ML problems and have a keen interest in MLOPs. I code mostly in Python, but currently also learning JavaScript and Clojure.

Apart from work, I like to read ([here's what I am currently reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/67593244-arjun-sehajpal?shelf=currently-reading)), go stargazing, and sometimes write short stories and poems.

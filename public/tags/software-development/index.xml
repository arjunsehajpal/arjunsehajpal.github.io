      <description>&lt;p&gt;The emergence of AI coding agents has fundamentally transformed how the software is developed. They’re no longer a novelty, but a legitimate part of a developer’s toolkit. Though early coding assistants like GitHub Copilot were only able to generate small code snippets and perform completions, as LLMs improved and the context window grew larger, it became easier to generate software directly from natural language instructions. This gave rise to vibe-coding. &lt;/br&gt;&#xA;Vibe-coding is great for greenfield use cases, prototyping and creative exploration, but is not equally performant on the existing codebases and legacy systems. This is because vibe-coding treats software development as a series of isolated interactions. This unstructured chain of interactions where one describes a goal, prompts the LLM and repeats until the code “feels right”, has led to proliferation of anti-patterns and code smells.&lt;/br&gt;&#xA;To overcome this, we need a coherent process that reasserts the primacy of structured thinking and intentional design. One of the software industry’s more rigorous answers to fill this gap is Spec-driven development (SDD).&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
